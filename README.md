# Multi-Asset-Portfolio-Return-Correlation-Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to generate synthetic multi-asset return data and visualize relationships between assets using Python. The focus is on data simulation, exploratory analysis, and correlation visualization, rather than real-world financial modeling or investment strategy.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to practice:
Simulating structured numerical datasets
Calculating basic summary statistics
Exploring relationships between multiple variables
Creating clear, interpretable visualizations in Python

## Repository Contents
Python scripts for generating simulated daily return data
Code for calculating summary statistics and correlation matrices
Visualization code for plotting asset return behavior and correlations

## Data Generation
Return data is synthetically generated using Python
Assets represent generic categories (e.g., stocks, bonds, crypto) and are not real securities
Data is intended solely for analytical and visualization practice

# Outputs
Line plots showing simulated daily returns for multiple assets
